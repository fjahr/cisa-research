## FAQs

<details>
  <summary>How could CISA improve Bitcoin privacy?</summary><br>

  - wide adoption of cj
  - default

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Exactly how much cost-savings could CISA provide across different types of transactions? This will include a comparison of full versus half aggregate implementations.</summary><br>

  - 1-in-2-out
  - average transaction

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How meaningful might these cost savings be to different industry participants? Given historical precedent, could these cost savings make Taproot the default script type, as Native Segwit is today?</summary><br>

  - could help

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Could CISA, if adopted widely, reduce the effectiveness of chain analysis?</summary><br>

  - only via incentivizing adoption of other privacy techniques
  - can also be detrimental
  - consolidating
  - common input heuristic

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Could CISA pave the way for cheaper transactions in a high-fee environment?</summary><br>

  - All transactions cheaper when aggregated
  - first need to get to new output type to profit
  - psbt aggregation with half-agg

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Could CISA lower the minimum economically spendable account at a given fee rate?</summary><br>

  - via consolidation transaction

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Could CISA help exchanges by, for example, saving them money while they consolidate small UTXOs?</summary><br>

  - yes, first move to new output

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How does CISA compare to other aggregation strategies?</summary><br>

  - Key aggregation
  - anything else exists?

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Are there any ways in which CISA could help upgrade or complement the Lightning Network, eCash, or existing CoinJoin mechanisms?</summary><br>

  - CoinJoin primary
  - Lightning no, musig use case
  - eCash no

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How might CISA protect the social and legal choice of Bitcoin users and businesses to CoinJoin, and the likelihood of more CoinJoin behavior, if users could state (if asked) that their decision was based on saving money, not simply seeking more privacy?</summary><br>

  TBD

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How would Bitcoin Core need to change to integrate CISA? Are there any known current improvement proposals?</summary><br>

  - new segwit version, no proposal

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How would SegWit need to change to integrate CISA?</summary><br>

  - new segwit version

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Could CISA be packaged with (and might it be mutually beneficial with) any existing softfork convent proposals?</summary><br>

  - anything can be deployed together, signalled independently
  -

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Would CISA have any impact on output destruction versus creation? How would implementation relate to the witness discount?</summary><br>

  - destruction is cheaper because signatures are associated with it

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How problematic would the interactive nature of full aggregate CISA be? What strategies might be adopted to ameliorate this?</summary><br>

  - Look at other protocols with similar properties
  - Need protocol with 

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What would be the main downsides and risks of bringing CISA to Bitcoin?</summary><br>

  - Upgrade comes with risks
  - Common input heuristic
  - People doing things wrong because of incentives to aggregate
  -

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How would a CISA-powered for-profit service that could help people save money on fees, if they are willing to enter an interactive pool, work?</summary><br>

  - same as cisa?
  - psbt aggregation server, full-agg

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What other kinds of CISA-powered apps can be envisioned?</summary><br>

  any wallet
  hugging psbt aggregation server, half-agg or full-agg
  PayJoin
